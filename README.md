Microblog-with-sinatra
======================


  a.  Build your own microblogging website from scratch using Sinatra, ActiveRecord, 
      and ERB
  b.  Users should be able to log in and post micro-blogs (similar to Twitter)
  c.  Users should have a “profile” page to display all of their blog entries so far and 
      where they can post new blogs
  d.  On the homepage, list all the posts made so far
  e.  Bonus: Users can follow other users
